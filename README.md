## Music bot

A bot for playing music.

-   Only a single queue with a music thread may be active at once in a server.

-   The queue may only be deleted by clicking the `â—¼` button.

-   Songs are added by typing the name/url of a youtube song/playlist in the music thread.

-   Bot requires at least one unmuted (non bot) listener.

    -   If no unmuted members are in the channel, bot will eventually disconnect.
    -   Reconnect it by clicking `Join`.

-   Queue message offers a variety of commands by clicking on buttons. (ex. loop, skip, shuffle, ... )

-   User may only use music commands if they are undeafened in a voice channel and bot is either in the same channel or not connected to any.

-   Bot requires a `DJ` role. Only users with the same role may use the music commands.

-   `/config` command allows setting which roles are allowed to use a command.
